### What is the PACIO Project?
The PACIO Project is a collaborative effort to advance interoperable health data exchange between post-acute care (PAC) and other providers, patients, and key stakeholders across health care and to promote health data exchange in collaboration with policy makers, standards organizations, and industry through a consensus-based, case-driven approach.

The goal of the PACIO Project is to gain industry adoption by establishing a framework for the development of post-acute care Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) Implementation Guides and Reference Implementations that will facilitate health data exchange through standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs).

### What is FHIR?
