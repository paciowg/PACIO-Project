### What is the PACIO Project?
The PACIO project is a collaborative effort to advance interoperable health data exchange between post-acute care providers, patients, and other key stakeholders across health care, using a consensus-based use case-driven approach.

The primary goal of the PACIO Project is to establish a framework for the development of post-acute care Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) technical implementation guides and Reference Implementations that will facilitate health data exchange through standards-based application programming interfaces (APIs).
