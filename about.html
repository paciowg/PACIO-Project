<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The PACIO Project is a collaborative effort to advance interoperable health data exchange between post-acute care (PAC) and other providers, patients, and key stakeholders across health care and to promote health data exchange in collaboration with policy makers, standards organizations, and industry through a consensus-based, use case-driven approach.</p>

<h2>PAC on FHIR</h2>
<p>The primary goal of the PACIO Project is to establish a framework for the development of Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) technical implementation guides and reference implementations that will facilitate health data exchange through standards-based use case-driven application programming interfaces (APIs).</p>

<h2>Why should you care about the PACIO Project?</h2>
<p>
	Care coordination – Forty-five percent of patients that leave hospitals go into some kind of post-acute care.  Post acute care accounts for <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/PAC_Hospice">$74 billion in Medicare payments annually</a>, so it is a large part of our healthcare system. Post-acute care patients are typically very complex and have multiple transitions in their healthcare journey.
</p>
<p>
	When a person transitions between healthcare settings, including ambulatory care, acute care, long-term post-acute care (LTPAC), and home- and community-based services (HCBS) – is often fragmented and can lead to poor health outcomes, increased burden, and increased costs.  Interoperable health information exchange has the potential to improve patient and provider communications and supports access to longitudinal health information that enables improved efficiencies, improved quality of care, and improved health outcomes. Data should be usable across the continuum of care, and beyond the traditional healthcare system – into the community.
